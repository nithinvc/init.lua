# Personal init.lua

This is my personal setup and configuration for keeping consistency. I do not recommend copying it - instead you should build your own. 


## TODOs
[ ] .bashrc setup for remote ssh servers
[ ] .zshrc setup for local dev
[ ] Double check tmux clean install - pretty sure there's a couple package downloads missing
[ ] nvim git integration
